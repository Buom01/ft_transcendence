- move every service, module, dto, entity, controller, into its own folder.
- Could you push the entity update on the db branch? To avoid too much different versions â€¦ our git is a mess theres multiple versions of everything in different branches
- merge with franco db after update!
- when changing pseudo rem to check if it doesnt exist yet and add number (e.g ltouret -> ltouret1)
