General:
- change route into async and other funcs & post?
- check & add missing dtos
- erase useless imports
- unistall nestjs + nodejs + yarn + npm from my pc?
- use same dockefile as rest with .env
- fix /auth/dto erase barrel import
- update path of imports later
- should not return 2fa secret when returning user 

Auth:
    erase auto_login in auth controller. 
    erase test_users in auth_svc
    add returns to routes
    so 42 should redirect to backend but backend should the redirect to home or 2FA page -> after login redirect to 127.0.0.1:3000/ (frontend) if logged in, if 2fa the  redirect to 2fa page of frontend

2FA:
    stop using response in 2fa service & controller, and fix turn-on & off (await and return types)

Users:
    when changing pseudo remember to check if it doesnt exist yet and return error -> talk with paul about return object
    add friends (online, offline, in a game, and so forth), add status in db.
    delete friends
    match history
    stats (such as: wins and losses, ladder level, achievements, and so forth)
    Could you create a func getFriends(User) in the user service? check if works -> wait for Franco
    erase entity in user email, password
