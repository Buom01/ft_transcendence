General:
- change route into async and other funcs & post?
- check & add missing dtos
- erase useless imports
- unistall nestjs + nodejs + yarn + npm from my pc?
- use same dockefile as rest with .env
- fix /auth/dto erase barrel import
- update path of imports later

Cookies:
    maxAge of cookies should be read from .env (Auth)

Auth:
    erase @Get("") in auth controller
    erase auto_login in auth controller. 
    erase test_users in auth_svc
    when signup is called avatar should not be 42 img, but the no-avatar.jpg aka the stormtrooper
    if an user is already logged with valid jwt we could check for them b4 trying to log in with 42 api, and let them through?
    will we add passwords?
    add returns to routes
    so 42 should redirect to backend but backend should the redirect to home or 2FA page -> after login redirect to 127.0.0.1:3000/ (frontend) if logged in, if 2fa the  redirect to 2fa page of frontend

Jwt:
    add jwt in websockets

2FA:
    stop using response in 2fa service & controller, and fix turn-on & off (await and return types)

Users:
    Decide if use userID as parameter or user directly to funcs. In all update funcs, in 2FA.
    erase show in user controller
    when changing pseudo remember to check if it doesnt exist yet and return error -> talk with paul about return object
    add friends (online, offline, in a game, and so forth), add status in ram
    delete friends
    match history
    stats (such as: wins and losses, ladder level, achievements, and so forth)
    Could you create a func getFriends(User) in the user service? check if works -> wait for Franco
