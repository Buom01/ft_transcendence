Auth:
    erase auto_login in auth controller. 
    erase test_users in auth_svc
    when signup is called avatar should not be 42 img, but the no-avatar.jpg aka the stormtrooper -> check again
    add returns to routes
    so 42 should redirect to backend but backend should the redirect to home or 2FA page -> after login redirect to 127.0.0.1:3000/ (frontend) if logged in, if 2fa the  redirect to 2fa page of frontend

    add jwt-spec-guard in branch leoV1.1, then merge

2FA:
    stop using response in 2fa service & controller, and fix turn-on & off (await and return types)

Users:
    Decide if use userID as parameter or user directly to funcs. In all update funcs, in 2FA.
    change show in user controller to serve avatar of backend.
    when changing pseudo remember to check if it doesnt exist yet and return error -> talk with paul about return object
    add friends (online, offline, in a game, and so forth), add status in db.
    delete friends

    stats (such as: wins and losses, ladder level, achievements, and so forth)
    Could you create a func getFriends(User) in the user service? check if works -> wait for Franco
